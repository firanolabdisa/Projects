# Question 2: What metric would you report for this dataset?

# Reporting metrics: 

# Order Amount (Sum total over the reporting period of March)
# Total Items (Sum total over the reporting period of March)
# To determine Average Order Value (AOV)

# First determine respective sums of both 'order_amount' and 'total_items'
oa_sum = data_df['order_amount'].sum()
ti_sum = data_df['total_items'].sum()
print(oa_sum)
print(ti_sum)
15725640
43936
# Then calculate average by dividing the total order amount (oa_sum) by the total items amount (ti_sum)
AOV = oa_sum/ti_sum
AOV
357.92152221412965
# Print Average Order Value (AOV) with only 2 decimal places and the dollar sign
print("%.2f" % AOV)
357.92
# Print correct explanation with $
'${:,.2f}'.format(AOV)
'$357.92'
# Incorrect calculation explained as a mistaken count() instead of sum() function
oa_sum = data_df['order_amount'].sum()
ti_count = data_df['total_items'].count()
AOV = oa_sum/ti_count
print(AOV)
3145.128
